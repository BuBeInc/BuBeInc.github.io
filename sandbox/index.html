            Hey, the name's SiBu. A tech nerd navigating through teaching
            herself web development. Ever since I can remember, I've always been
            drawn to creating: 
            <ul>
                <li> dabbled in my own series of stickmen comics </li>
                <li> discovered writing without visuals and published
            a few wattpad stories (don't bother searching them up, I buried
            those where no one can find them) </li>
                <li> discovered music: played instruments and even composed some songs of my own
            (that's just a narcissistic way of saying I sang the alphabet in the style of negro-gospel, 
            pasting on a tune I had probably picked up from a radio.) </li>
            </ul> 
            <br>
            Then I found coding, the perfect scratch to satisfy my
            persistant itch: creating algorithms, frameworks, layouts from
            my own logic, my own creativity and seeing it come into
            fruition.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is my creative canvas. My space to watch an idea
            come to life - growing from words on a screen to a
            fully-realised product. Each aspect of the page is the final,
            perfected version obtained from a lot of trail-and-error, and
            natural enhancement of my skills. You can see the creation and
            update logs by clicking the little shovel in the bottom-right
            corner of the page. (pretty cool, huh?) 
        </p>
